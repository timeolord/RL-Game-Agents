# RL-Game_agents

This uses the open ai gym enviroments and stable baselines to train reinforcement agents. Currently two envs have been implemented, Brawlhalla and Hotline Miami 2, 
the Brawlhalla env has hard coded mouse positions so is unlikely to work on anyone elses computer. While the Hotline Miami 2 env should work if you change the directory for the game and get the static address of the module.
